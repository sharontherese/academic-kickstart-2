Each year, we revisit the burning question of our generation:

**Did the “Turkey Indult” really happen?**

In 1958, did Pope Pius XII allow Catholics to eat meat the Friday after Thanksgiving?

The answer is no…and yes. The Turkey Indult happened, but not how we think.

# A definitive answer 

Let’s cut to the chase. Contrary to many blog posts and memes out there, we can confidently say that there was a pzpzl turkey indult in 1958, thanks to this Pittsburgh Catholic newspaper article. 

Q: “I am wondering why a dispensation was not given for the Friday after Thanksgiving this year. One was given last year…”

A: "...in granting the relaxation of the abstinence on the Friday after Thanksgiving in 1958 he set no precedent but granted a particular favor for a particular year."

So...why the confusion?

# More mysteries

Notice...the article never says the name of the pope. 

Pius XII died on October 9, 1958. While it's possible he issued a turkey indult on his deathbed, more than a month before Thanksgiving, he couldn’t have done so in 1959.

The only logical explanation is that the turkey indult - which we now know happened, and was definitely papally issued - came from Pope St. John XXIII, who issued a turkey indult in 1958 but chose not to do so in 1959.

(Sidebar: Although…did John XXIII really say that the purpose of the Council was to let the fresh air in to the Church? **INSERT FOOTNOTE**)

Back to papal indults. 

John XXIII was elected on October 28, 1958, and was notable for haphazard new ideas. (Schillebeeckx line about St. Joseph in the canon?]

> I myself find it depressing that I have to write two articles with all kinds of theological distinctions and explanations in order to bring some clarity. When such a thing is necessary, it clearly indicates an opaque situation and the faithful are thoroughly fed up with all these learned explanations. I can only agree with that. We also had to constantly make distinctions with Pope John, but his attitude was overwhelmingly humane and liberating which is why we did not make a spectacle when he suddenly placed St. Joseph in the canon at odds with the council, even though the church had no express need for it. John could have proclaimed Mary as Mother of the Church with the same nonchalance. We would have kindly smiled on. The one who does not take himself seriously but takes the church surprisingly seriously may, for our part, occasionally act against our wishes. But now we have a Pope that takes the church just as seriously but also his ecclesiastical office and for him that is the primateship (which dogmatically contains somewhat more than the “primus inter pares” or hon ourary president!) with which he, in a strong sense of apostleship, entirely identifies himself.

# more indults

John XXIII issued new indults throughout the first year of his pontificate, including:

* the Friday after Christmas, 1958
* May 1, The Feast of St. Joseph the Worker, 1959
* August 14, the Vigil of the Assumption, 1959

His innovative indults caused international headlines from Catholic and secular newspapers alike. 

The thing is, because these were brand-new indults, it appears that the usual channels of communication did not work. Some dioceses didn’t even hear about the indults until the day the indults applied, making it too late to do anything. 

So you have the unusual situation, for example, of the Diocese of X following the indult and the neighboring Diocese Y not even aware the indult exists. 

**Catholic Transcript, 13 June 1935**

# A weary world

By 1960, the press stopped covering papal indults with this fervor, the Canadian bishops abolished ember days and Lenten fasting and abstinence, and 1960 saw a diocesan turkey indult from Pittsburgh. 

In 1962, Connecticut, the Diocese of Stockton, and the Archdiocese of San Francisco joined them. 

In 1962, the Council eclipsed everything, the fasting and abstinence laws were about to change, and this entire melodrama became moot. 

NEVERTHELESS, a papal turkey indult in 1958 did happen! 

Why didn’t it get more coverage? Well, that can be mostly answered by looking at the utter confusion following John XXIII’s subsequent indults. Let me paint a picture. 

# Painting a picture

October 9, 1958, Pius XII dies. 

October 28, John XXIII is elected. 

November 27 is Thanksgiving Day. Sometime between October 28 and November 27 - likely very close to November 27 - John XXIII fires off a brand new papal “Turkey Indult.” 

Given the lateness of the hour, the typical chaos of ushering in a new pope, the pope’s unconventional approaches in general, news of the Turkey Indult doesn’t make it across the whole world, let alone to the newspapers. 

**Christmas 1958:**

May 1, 1959: John XXIII issues an indult for the Feast of St. Joseph the Worker (on a Friday that year). The Diocese of Erie announced it only applied to Europeans. The Archdiocese of Philly announced it applied to them…but they’d only received notice of the indult on April 30! 

August 14, 1959: John XXIII issues an indult for the Vigil of the Assumption. The Diocese of Lafayette, Indiana did not receive confirmation in time to announce the indult at Sunday Masses. An article from Ontario, Canada was waiting on confirmation (suggesting, like John XXIII’s other indults, they were released last-minute).

Thanksgiving, 1959, someone in the Diocese of Pittsburgh, PA remembers that the pope said he could eat meat last Thanksgiving Friday. He writes his newspaper - can he do so again? The priest responds no, that was a one-time deal. Note that the priest doesn’t say “the pope didn’t issue a turkey indult,” or “that wasn’t the pope, that was your bishop.”

Remember, by 1958, Catholics had already seen numerous reforms, including a transformed Holy Week in 1955. Come 1960, there would be a colossal avalanche of changes. Hand missals constantly needing new inserts. New stuff at Mass every week. Reforms applied unevenly across dioceses.

Is it any wonder that we forgot such a small fact like the Papal Turkey Indult of 1958? Who could possibly keep up with all of this? 

# Conclusion

In terms of current practice, all of this is moot, of course. But as a fun, academic exercise, the turkey indult is THE MOST FUN. 

A pope issued a Turkey Indult in 1958. It’s almost a guarantee that that pope was John XXIII, and that the indult was for one year only.

We know this because of ONE single solitary newspaper column in 1959! And it upends years and years of debate! Imagine what else is out there, lurking in newspapers and pamphlets and primary sources! What small historical mysteries might you unravel from trawling the Catholic News Archive, or JSTOR, or ?????
