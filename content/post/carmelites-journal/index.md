Each year, I run searches for the Carmelite martyrs of Compiegne to see if I can find them in 18th century art, newspapers, pamphlets, etc. This year's finding was an issue of the Journal de Paris. 

The Journal de Paris was a long-running daily newspaper in Paris. During the French Revolution, Journal issues typically began with the section "Convention Nationale," with summaries of the sessions (seances) from the day before. There were also occasional sections for Musique, Variete, Commune de Paris, and Municipalite de Paris. 

Of interest to us is the section Tribunale Revolutionnaire, which recorded the names, ages, and birth towns of the people sentenced to death the day before. Because sentences were frequently carried out the same day that they were handed down, this list can also be seen as a list of the previous day's executions. 

On July 18, 1794, the Journal de Paris published the names of those executed on July 17. Included in this list are the 16 Carmelites, listed not by their religious names (to be expected) but by their birth names. The list ended with "dernieres ex-Carmelites a Compiegne."

# List of Carmelites

I borrowed Wikipedia's list of the Carmelites, and added a few notes. I reordered the names, to match how they appear in the Journal. There are a few discrepancies with name spellings and ages. 

* Mother Henriette of Jesus, ex-prioress for two terms, elected by the community in 1779 and 1782; novice mistress (Marie-Françoise Gabrielle de **Croissy**). Born in Paris, 18 June 1745.

* Sister Teresa of the Sacred Heart of Mary (Marie-Antoniette **Hanisset**). Born in Rheims in 1740 or 1742.
** Journal: Hannisset
** Journal: 52 years old, which would make her birth year 1742.  
* Mother Teresa of St. Augustine, prioress (Madeleine-Claudine **Ledoine**). Born in Paris, 22 September 1752.

# Bonus

10 days after the Carmelites were killed (as William Bush pointed out, exactly 1 revolutionary week), Maximilian Robespierre was executed in the same way. His arrest and death are recorded in the July 27 and 28 issues of the Journal de Paris.
