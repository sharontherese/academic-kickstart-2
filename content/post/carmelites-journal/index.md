Each year, I run searches for the Carmelite martyrs of Compiegne to see where I can find them in the historical record.[^1] This year's finding was an issue of the _Journal de Paris_.[^2] 

The _Journal de Paris_ was a long-running daily newspaper in Paris. During the French Revolution, its issues typically began with the section _Convention Nationale_, with summaries of the sessions (_seances_) from the day before. There were also occasional sections for _Musique_, _Variete_, _Commune de Paris_, and _Municipalite de Paris_. 

Of interest to us is the section _Tribunale Revolutionnaire_, which recorded the names, ages, and birth towns of the people sentenced to death the day before. Because sentences were frequently carried out the same day that they were handed down, this list can also be seen as a list of the previous day's executions. 

On July 18, 1794, the Journal de Paris published the names of those executed on July 17. Included in this list are the 16 Carmelites, listed by their birth names. The list ended with "dernieres ex-Carmelites a Compiegne."

# List of Carmelites

I borrowed Wikipedia's list of the Carmelites, and added a few notes. I reordered the names, to match how they appear in the _Journal_. There are a few discrepancies with name spellings and ages. 

- Mother Henriette of Jesus (Marie-Françoise Gabrielle de **Croissy**). Born in Paris, 18 June 1745.
  - Journal: Croisy
- Sister Teresa of St. Ignatius (Marie-Gabrielle **Trézel**) Born in Compiègne, 4 April 1743.
- Sister Teresa of the Sacred Heart of Mary (Marie-Antoniette **Hanisset**). Born in Rheims in 1740 or 1742.
  - Journal: Hannisset
  - Journal: 52 years old, which would make her birth year 1742.  
- Mother Teresa of St. Augustine (Madeleine-Claudine **Ledoine**). Born in Paris, 22 September 1752.
  - Journal: Lidoine
- Sister Mary-Henrietta of Providence (Anne **Petras**). Born in Cajarc, 17 June 1760.

  - Journal: 55 years old, but a birth year of 1742 would be 52 years old.
- Thérèse Soiron, born in 1748

# Bonus

10 days after the Carmelites were killed (as William Bush pointed out, exactly 1 revolutionary week), Maximilian Robespierre was executed in the same way. His arrest and death are recorded in the July 28 and 29 issues of the _Journal de Paris_.
