On the morning of July 6, a bride and groom prepared for their traditional Catholic wedding. The photographer and videographer were on hand to document an historic union of two Catholic families. The groom had commissioned wedding booklets with the ceremonies in Latin and English, to assist the many guests who had never been to such old ceremonies. 

The year was 1905, and the couple was John Crichton-Stuart and Augusta Mary Monica Bellingham.

The father of the groom, the 3rd Marquess of Bute, deserves an article in his own right, which I cannot provide here. Here is a memoir[^1] of one of his Benedictine friends, and a more recent biography[^2] of Crichton-Stuart III). John Chrichton-Stuard, was not only the richest man in the world at the time, but the first English translator of the Roman Breviary.[^3] [^4] [^5] The father of the bride was Sir Alan Henry Bellingham, who among other roles, served as Private Chamberlain to Popes Pius IX, Leo XIII, and Pius X.

Setting that aside...the most interesting thing about this wedding is that, despite being more than 100 years ago, we have a wedding program AND wedding video footage! 

# The Wedding Film

The National Library of Scotland has generously made available this historic film - likely the only film of its kind.

From the Library's record:

> Curator's Note: This is a personal wedding film - a record for the participants of their happy event. Nothing unusual in that except for its date - 1905. This was the era of the itinerant showman and the entrepreneur who would run picture shows at the fairground and music and variety halls. It would be another five years before purpose built cinemas - picture palaces - start to appear...The aristocracy rarely engaged with cinema in this period...This then makes this film particularly interesting. An aristocratic couple engaging a film company to record their nuptials. It is - we think - one of the earliest - if not the earliest family wedding film in this country. It would be another 20 years before the first generation of home movie cameras came into use, and it pre-dates the cinema newsreel when celebrity weddings would be filmed for the news.
