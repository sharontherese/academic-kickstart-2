On the morning of July 6, a bride and groom prepared for their traditional Catholic wedding. The photographer and videographer were on hand to document an historic union of two Catholic families. The groom had commissioned wedding booklets with the ceremonies in Latin and English, to assist the many guests who had never been to such old ceremonies. 

The year was 1905, and the couple was John Crichton-Stuart and Augusta Mary Monica Bellingham. 

The father of the groom, the 3rd Marquess of Bute, deserves an article in his own right, which I cannot provide here. Here is a memoir[^1] of one of his Benedictine friends, and a more recent biography[^2] of Crichton-Stuart III). John Chrichton-Stuard, was not only the richest man in the world at the time, but the first English translator of the Roman Breviary.[^3] [^4] [^5] 

The father of the bride was Sir Alan Henry Bellingham, who among other roles, served as Private Chamberlain to Popes Pius IX, Leo XIII, and Pius X.

Setting that aside, the most interesting thing about this wedding is that, despite being more than 100 years ago, we have a wedding program AND wedding video footage!
