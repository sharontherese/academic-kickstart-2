There are four Marian antiphons that are sung throughout the liturgical year, during the Divine Office and sometimes after Mass. 

_Alma Redemptoris Mater_ is sung from Advent to Candlemas. 

_Ave Regina Caelorum_ is sung from Candlemas through Wednesday of Holy Week. 

_Regina Caeli_ is sung throughout Easter. 

_Salve Regina_ is sung from Trinity Sunday to the first Sunday of Advent. 

I made letter-sized (8.5x11) posters, one for each Marian antiphon. Included for each is a woodcut from Albrecht Durer's unfinished work _Life of the Virgin_.
