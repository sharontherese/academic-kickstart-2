This document summarizes and visualize key selections from the 1,000+ pages of the 2018 P.A. Grand Jury Report. 

Data visualizations are provided at the beginning of the document to give a broad overview of the cases. Following that is a section on Trends and Patterns, which are my own observations from reading the report. Sections II-V are quotations taken directly from the Grand Jury Report.
