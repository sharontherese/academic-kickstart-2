summary: In heated discussions on faith and science, one expert is routinely overlooked: Stanley L. Jaki, OSB (1924-2009). Jaki, a Hungarian priest, was one of the most decorated scientists of his generation. He is perhaps most well known for his books on the history of science, but he wrote prolifically on a variety of topics ranging from G. K. Chesterton to computers to a delightfully scientific commentary on the Psalms.
