_Periti_ were priests invited by the Vatican to assist the Second Vatican Council as theological experts. 

Chosen for their particular merits, the periti wielded great influence before, during, and after the Council. The periti served almost every conceivable role: translating, drafting, revising, advising, correcting, conferring, discussing. They worked with other periti, established daily panels and briefings for the press, and about 5% of periti became bishops during the Council. 

After the Council, they went home and ran parishes,  seminaries, radio stations, publishing houses, workshops, conferences, retreats, newspapers, missions, and universities. Some wrote hundreds of volumes; some wrote nothing. Some faced criminal charges, some are on the path to sainthood, some left the Church. One became Pope! 

Despite being the most important religious event of the last century, the Council remains curiously under-documented regarding its actual participants. To date, there is no publicly available list of all council periti.

This project fills that gap.

Using the list of 479 council periti as recorded in the “Index Peritorum,” Acta synodalia Sacrosancti Concilii Oecumenici Vaticani II. Indices (1980), and supplementing with private periti as I find them, I have created a research tool in two parts to explore the periti. 

1) The spreadsheet has the full list of known periti, with over 30 data points to answer who the periti were, and what they did. 

2) To complement the spreadsheet, I have a public Zotero library for all of my references. Periti are tagged: lastname, firstname. 

Both the spreadsheet and the reference library are freely downloadable; I encourage you to download them, make it your own, and draw novel conclusions.

Contact me with any corrections, suggestions, or requests.
