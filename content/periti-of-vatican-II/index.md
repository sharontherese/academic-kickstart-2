_Periti_ were priests invited by the Vatican to assist the Second Vatican Council as theological experts. 

Chosen for their particular merits, the periti wielded great influence before, during, and after the Council. The periti served almost every conceivable role: translating, drafting, revising, advising, correcting, conferring, discussing. They worked with other periti, established daily panels and briefings for the press, and about 5% of periti became bishops during the Council. 

After the Council, they went home and ran parishes,  seminaries, radio stations, publishing houses, workshops, conferences, retreats, newspapers, missions, and universities. Some wrote hundreds of volumes; some wrote nothing. Some faced criminal charges, some are on the path to sainthood, some left the Church. One became Pope! 

Despite being the most important religious event of the last century, the Council remains curiously under-documented regarding its actual participants. To date, there is no publicly available list of all council periti.

This project fills that gap.

Using the list of 479 council periti as recorded in the “Index Peritorum,” Acta synodalia Sacrosancti Concilii Oecumenici Vaticani II. Indices (1980), and supplementing with private periti as I find them, I have created a research tool in two parts to explore the periti. 

1) The spreadsheet has the full list of known periti, with over 30 data points to answer who the periti were, and what they did. 

2) To complement the spreadsheet, I have a public Zotero library for all of my references. Periti are tagged: lastname, firstname. 

Both the spreadsheet and the reference library are freely downloadable; I encourage you to download them, make it your own, and draw novel conclusions.

# About 

**The Periti of Vatican II** is an open source project cataloging the theological experts (periti) who advised the Second Vatican Council. Using the list of 479 council periti as published in the _Acta synodalia Sacrosancti Concilii Oecumenici Vaticani II_ as a foundation, **The Periti of Vatican II** is a spreadsheet of all known periti, conciliar and private, with over 30 data points to prove their identity, their connection to the Council, and their influence in the Church. Complementing the spreadsheet is a Zotero library, with references for most spreadsheet links, and the results of many literature searches I conducted. 

The Periti of Vatican II  was created and is managed by Sharon Kabel, librarian and independent researcher. 

## What’s a “periti”?

_Peritus_ (plural, _periti_) is Latin for “expert.” In the context of the Second Vatican Council, periti were priests, non-voting members of the Council. Periti were classified as either Council or private. 

> “There were two categories of periti: Council and private. The pope appointed the Council periti, they could be assigned to serve on Conciliar commissions in addition to advising bishops. Individual bishops invited private periti for personal consultation and had no official standing at the Council.”
> 
> Pyne, Tricia T. “The Archives of the Second Vatican Council Fathers Project: A Report from the United States.” U.S. Catholic Historian 30, no. 3 (2012): 51–63.

## What were your sources? How do we know who the periti were? 

For council periti, my sole source was: 

> “Index Peritorum.” In _Acta synodalia Sacrosancti Concilii Oecumenici Vaticani II. Indices,_ 937–49. Vatican City: Typis polyglottis Vaticanis, 1980.

For private periti, I found them either incidentally through my research, or from searching the Catholic News Archive for: 

> peritus OR periti OR "council expert"~3

The article below covered American periti, and I used Father Weiser’s list as cross-references for the Vatican’s list. 

> Weiser, Francois. “The Periti of the United States and the Second Vatican Council: Prosopography of a Group of Theologians.” U.S. Catholic Historian 30, no. 3 (2012): 65–91.

Lists of periti were also published in the Commisioni Conciliari, Annuario Pontificio, Civilta Cattolica, and the Irish Ecclesiastical Review, although I have not found hard copies yet. 

## So how many periti were there? 

The Vatican lists 479 council periti. Weiser says there were 480. Pyne says there were 484. 

Discrepancies continue on the country level. Weiser lists 87 American periti, 12 of whom became bishops. Pyne lists 85 American periti, 9 of whom became bishops. Currently, my American numbers agree with Weiser, but that could change as I continue to research. 

I have found 44 private periti so far, although several names may be typos of council periti. We will likely never know the total number of private periti. 

## How did you verify the periti? What data did you collect? 

The project started very simply. As it stood, the Vatican’s 1980 Acta list was nearly useless for me as a research tool, because of the layout of the text and the Latin first names. My goal was to retype the list, and add in the “real” first names. 

As I retyped the names and noted typos (which were depressingly frequent), the scope grew and grew and grew. 

The original data points were from the Vatican’s list:

1. Last name 
2. Latinized first name 
3. Order (if applicable)
4. Attended Session I?
5. Attended Session II?
6. Attended Session III?
7. Attended Session IV?

While I searched a wide variety of search engines and databases to help me identify the periti, I looked in particular at:

8. Wikipedia
9. Wikidata
10. Virtual International Authority File (VIAF)
11. Worldcat Identities 
12. Catholic-Hierarchy
13. Find a Grave
14. Selected mention (a non-standardized reference to the peritus that confirmed their existence, name, and connection to the Council, such as a newspaper article, obituary, or book review) 

I owe a great debt to the Catholic News Archive, which saved me countless hours of searching for each peritus’ non-Latinized name. 

From those author identifiers, I looked for the following additional data points: 

15. Status (council or private peritus?)
16. Number of Wikipedia pages (captured in December 2022)
17. Country represented/country of origin (For example, some American periti were not American-born. They represented America at the Council, so I counted them as American. When I was unsure, I defaulted to country of origin, and the name of the country at the time of the peritus’ birth. I regret I may not have been perfectly consistent with this data point.)
18. Birth year 
19. Death year 
20. Age at start of Council
21. Age at death 
22. Highest episcopal title (I looked for Superior General, Bishop, Cardinal, and Pope. A Cardinal-Deacon was counted as a Cardinal. An Archbishop was counted as a Bishop.) 
23. Important (I have two definitions of “important”: was a peritus well known, or was their work highly influential even if they were not a household name?)
24. Photo no reuse (a link to a photo of the peritus, with unclear copyright status)
25. Photo reuse (a link to a photo of the peritus, in the public domain)
26. Change during Council (did the peritus become a bishop or die during the Council?)
27. Memoir on the Council (did the peritus write a book or article about their time as a peritus? I generally did not count autobiographies unless there was a chapter/section on the Council.) 
28. Typo (did the Vatican’s list have a typo?)
29. Credibly accused (Was the peritus credibly accused of child sexual abuse? This is only applicable to American periti, because I lack access to or awareness of lists/databases of clerical abuse in other countries.) 
30. Ethics Watch (did the peritus take a public position on something contrary to Church teaching? Were the accused of a crime other than child sexual abuse?) 
31. Left priesthood (did the peritus leave the priesthood and/or marry?) 
32. Notes (was there any other fact about the peritus that I thought was important to highlight?)

No peritus has data for all of these data points. Many periti do not even have all 7 author identifiers. One reason I looked for so many identifiers is so that I could rely on a reasonable web of evidence for each peritus. One peritus might have Wikipedia pages in 6 languages, pages on Catholic-Hierarchy, Wikidata, VIAF, and Worldcat; another peritus might only have a short obituary in The Times-Picayune to his name. Both are enough for me to tie that person to the Latin name on the Vatican’s list. 

## Where is all of this data? 

This project is in two parts, linked at the top of this page.

1. The list of all known periti, along with the data points above, is in a spreadsheet in Google Sheets. 
2. All research – links in the spreadsheet, and much, much more – is in a Zotero library. 

Both the spreadsheet of data and the library of research are freely accessible and downloadable.
