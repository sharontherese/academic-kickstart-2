I am a Catholic librarian interested in finding high quality information, arranging it usefully, and aggressively citing my sources.

I study and write about traditional Catholic weddings, Catholic fact checks, newspapers, and research methods.

> Which has the quality of something made, <br/>
> Like a good fiddle, like the rose’s scent, <br/>
> Like a rose window or the firmament.
