# Reference and Research

Need to get to the bottom of something and don't know where to start? I can help you answer questions, find resources, and collate information. 

Examples of reference and research projects I have done: 

* fact checks: Did St. John Chrysostom really say this quote on wifely submission?  
* literature reviews: Can you collect resources on health outcomes of solitary confinement? 
* research questions: What is the history of the celebration of Hanukkah?
